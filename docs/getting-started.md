# Getting Started
**CIMTool** is an [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) plugin written in Java so you can run CIMTool on Windows, Linux or Mac OS. However, *only the Windows binary is prebuilt* in the release, for other platforms you must compile from Java source. You'll need at least 200MB free disk space (more if you will be working with large Contextual Profiles).

To run the Windows binary:

  1. Install Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8+. If you donâ€™t have java, Zulu is a good option. You can download Zulu JRE [here](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk#zulu).
  2. [Download](https://github.com/CIMug-org/CIMTool/releases) the lastest CIMTool as .zip file
  3. Unzip the package to the location of your choice
  4. Click on the CIMTool.exe and the application will start
  5. Define a 'workspace' directory when prompted and the workbench view will then appear
