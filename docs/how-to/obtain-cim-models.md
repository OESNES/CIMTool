# Where to Obtain Stable Releases of the CIM

One of the first questions often asked is "Where do I locate and download stable releases of the CIM UML model for use with Sparx EA?" 

## Obtain the CIM UML

UCAIug Task Force 13 (TF13), UCAIug Task Force 14 (TF14), and UCAIug Task Force 16 (TF16) are groups that work to advance the CIM and who publish periodic releases of the CIM UML. These releases are published to the [UCAIug (CIM Users Group)](https://cimug.ucaiug.org/) website in [Enterprise Architect](https://sparxsystems.com/) project file (`.eap` or `.eapx`) format.

Both past and current stables releases of these CIM EA project files are made publicly available for download from the UCAIug. Current releases can be found at [Current CIM Model Drafts](https://cimug.ucaiug.org/CIM%20Model%20Releases/Forms/AllItems.aspx) and this page should look similar to the next screenshot. Older releases are available at [Past CIM Model Releases](https://cimug.ucaiug.org/CIM%20Releases/Forms/AllItems.aspx).
