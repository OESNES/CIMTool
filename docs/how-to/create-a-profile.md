# Create a Contextual Profile
There are four ways to create a new Contextual Profile:

  1. Create it from scratch within **CIMTool**
  2. Import from previously saved (`.owl` file) using **CIMTool**
  3. Import the Contextual Profile from a data dictionary spreadsheet
  4. Copy and paste an existing Contextual Profile within CIMTool

Once created, Contextual Profiles are stored in the "Profiles" folder of the project. A project may have many Contextual Profiles. Each Contextual Profiles will have a namespace.
