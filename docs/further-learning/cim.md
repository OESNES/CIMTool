# CIM
The Common Information Model (CIM) can be overwhelming to newcomers. There is a large amount of technical jargon within CIM, the IEC numbering
and versioning system, and also within the governing bodies that oversee CIM such as the [CIM Users Group](https://cimug.ucaiug.org/). This 
page gives more context to some of this jargon and can be used as a reference as you navigate and learn CIM for yourself.

## Standards Mapping
The CIM Users Group has a good summary of various CIM Standards and how they map to plain english descriptions. You can find it [here](https://cimug.ucaiug.org/Pages/CIM%20Standards%20Map.aspx).

Below is also a helpful illustration of this mapping.
